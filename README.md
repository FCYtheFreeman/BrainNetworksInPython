Welcome to the BrainNetworksInPython GitHub repository!:sparkles:

## What are we doing?
BrainNetworksInPython is a toolkit to analyse structural covariance brain networks using python.  

BrainNetworksInPython takes regional cortical thickness data obtained from structural MRI and generates a matrix of correlations between regions over a cohort of subjects. The correlation matrix is used alongside the networkx package to generate networks and network measures.

Check out our [tutorial](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython/blob/master/Example_JupyterNotebook.ipynb) to get started.
